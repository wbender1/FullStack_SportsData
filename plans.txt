üß± Phase 1: Containerize Your Django App
1. Create a Dockerfile

You‚Äôll define your app‚Äôs environment (Python version, dependencies, etc.) so it runs identically anywhere.
It typically includes:

A base Python image (e.g., python:3.11-slim)

Commands to install dependencies (requirements.txt)

Instructions to collect static files and run Gunicorn

(You don‚Äôt need the code yet ‚Äî you‚Äôll write it once we start hands-on.)

2. Add a .dockerignore file

Prevents unnecessary local files (like .venv, migrations cache, etc.) from being sent to Docker‚Äôs build context.

3. Set up docker-compose.yml

This will let you define multiple containers ‚Äî for example:

web: your Django app

db: PostgreSQL

nginx: reverse proxy (optional at first)

This allows you to spin up your full app stack with a single command:

docker-compose up --build

üß∞ Phase 2: Secure the App

Before deploying:

Set environment variables securely

Store SECRET_KEY, DATABASE_URL, and any API keys in a .env file.

Use django-environ or os.getenv() in settings.py.

Turn off debug mode

DEBUG = False
ALLOWED_HOSTS = ['your-domain.com']


Use Gunicorn + Nginx

Gunicorn runs Django.

Nginx sits in front, serving static files and handling HTTPS.

Collect and serve static files correctly

Run python manage.py collectstatic.

Mount /static and /media volumes properly in Docker.

Use HTTPS

Once deployed, use a free SSL certificate (Let‚Äôs Encrypt) through AWS Load Balancer or Nginx.

‚òÅÔ∏è Phase 3: Deploy to AWS

You‚Äôll have two strong options:

Option A ‚Äì AWS Elastic Beanstalk

Easiest way to deploy a Dockerized Django app.

Handles scaling, load balancing, HTTPS, logs, and updates.

You just push your Docker config.

Option B ‚Äì AWS ECS (Elastic Container Service)

More control, better for long-term scaling or multi-container setups.

You‚Äôll define a ‚Äútask‚Äù for Django, connect to RDS (PostgreSQL), and run behind a Load Balancer.

üõ°Ô∏è Phase 4: Add Production Extras

Database: Use AWS RDS for PostgreSQL.

Static files: Host on AWS S3 and link it via django-storages.

Error tracking: Use Sentry or AWS CloudWatch.

CI/CD: Set up GitHub Actions to automatically build and push new Docker images.

‚úÖ What You‚Äôll End Up With

A full production setup that looks like this:

Browser
  ‚Üì
HTTPS (Nginx / AWS Load Balancer)
  ‚Üì
Gunicorn (Django container)
  ‚Üì
RDS (PostgreSQL)
  ‚Üì
S3 (Static/media files)
